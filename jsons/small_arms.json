    "desc": "Some manufacturers have streamlined the disintegrator pistol’s design to create a more affordable option; the result of their efforts is referred to simply as a decoupler. A decoupler is smaller and lighter than a disintegrator pistol, trading some of its outright destructive power for the ability to deal superficial pain that can leave targets shaking in their boots. In the Apostaean city of Nightarch, the ruling House Zeizerer issues decouplers to its enforcers, many of whom refer to the weapons as “facilitators.” Manufacturers typically produce bruiser, pusher, and screamer decouplers."

Some of the first versions were produced by starship manufacturers and were accompanied by a promotional campaign suggesting that a starship’s crew should match the starship itself, complete with flight suits to match a given ship’s paint job. Most manufacturers still use the model classification set forth in those early campaigns: explorer, fighter, pilot, and capital handcoils."
