If you succeed, the target of your healing tendril gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its next saving throw against the affliction and you don’t contract the affliction yourself. If you fail, the target of your healing tendril gains a +2 bonus to its next saving throw against the affliction and you contract the affliction yourself. You can use your healing tendril once per day. You cannot use your healing tendril on yourself.\n When you use a rejuvenating or melding tendril, the target regains HP equal to your level + your Constitution modifier. A melding tendril can also be used as a unity tendril of the same mark. When used as a unity tendril, your melding tendril does not stabilize, heal, or grant the target a bonus against afflictions. However, if you have already attached your melding tendril to a creature, you can take a standard action to use the healing properties of your tendril on it.\n"

Select one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic); you gain an amount of resistance to that energy type based on the model of your resistant hide. If you have a racial trait that provides resistance to the selected energy type that’s equal to or greater than that of your resistant hide (and doesn’t explicitly stack with other sources of energy resistance), adding resistant hide increases the value of the energy resistance from the trait by 2. If you have a racial trait that provides resistance to the selected energy type of a value less than that of your resistant hide, the value of the resistance from your resistant hide increases by 2. \u003ctable class\u003d\"inner\"\u003e\n \u003ctbody\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003eModel\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003eLevel\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003ePrice\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003eResistance\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eMk 1\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e700\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eMk 2\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e4\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e1,900\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e4\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eMk 3\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e7\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e5,890\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e6\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eMk 4\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e10\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e17,000\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e8\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eMk 5\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e13\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e46,350\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e10\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eMk 6\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e17\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e230,850\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e12\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n"

You cannot use your healing tendril on yourself.\n When you use a rejuvenating or melding tendril, the target regains HP equal to your level + your Constitution modifier. A melding tendril can also be used as a unity tendril of the same mark. When used as a unity tendril, your melding tendril does not stabilize, heal, or grant the target a bonus against afflictions.

If your bone spines are extended and an opponent within 5 feet hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal the listed piercing damage to that attacker. If your opponent\u0027s attack roll is a natural 20, the attacker also gains the bleeding condition equal to the item level of your spines. If you have natural weapons and those weapons are magical, the damage dealt by your bone spines is also magical. \u003ctable class\u003d\"inner\"\u003e \n \u003ctbody\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003eModel\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003eLevel\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003ePrice\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003eDamage\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e \n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eBristling\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e5\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e2,900\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e1d4 P\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e \n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eWarding\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e9\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e12,900\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e2d4 P\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e \n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003ePunishing\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e13\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e47,900\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e4d4 P\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e \n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eRebuking\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e17\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e242,900\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e8d4 P\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e \n \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n"
