    "desc": "A hardlight hand wrap consists of a small generator of force energy built into a form-fitting glove made of interwoven photoelectric ribbon. The weapon uses cutting-edge hologram technology to create bursts of hardlight that can briefly interact with both corporeal and incorporeal beings. It takes a bit of training to perfect the timing of strikes made with a hardlight hand wrap, as you must activate the force generator at the precise moment you hit your target, but many feel that the practice is worth the effort. Relatively inconspicuous and easily modifiable to fit any species’ anatomy, hardlight hand wraps are invaluable when facing living holograms, ghosts, and other incorporeal dangers."

When powered, the talon converts energy into acid that can melt through certain types of armor (though the weapon always targets a foe’s KAC). Shirrens favor talons, and some consider them to be holy weapons of Hylax, referring to them as the queen’s talons. Increasingly advanced models of the weapon are often named after roles of some hivedwelling species, beginning with drone, and advancing through warrior, knight, queen, and god."

The result is a black, snakelike lash crackling with red-tinged energy, making this a weapon commonly wielded by those looking to intimidate their foes. Disintegration lashes are designated in the standard method for disintegrator weapons: liquidator, decimator, executioner, and eradicator."

While it is most often wielded in melee, the junk censer can also be thrown at an enemy. Like many cobbled-together weapons, a junk censer is unstable; on an attack roll of a natural 1, it deals its regular damage to the user and gains the broken condition."

Battle ribbons are difficult to use without training, so most who take up the battle ribbon seek apprenticeship with the famous battleflowers of Ning to learn the elaborate performance art—though acquiring such a mentor is difficult, as they take students only rarely.

Battle ribbons are difficult to use without training, so most who take up the battle ribbon seek apprenticeship with the famous battleflowers of Ning to learn the elaborate performance art—though acquiring such a mentor is difficult, as they take students only rarely. Battle ribbon varieties start with modern materials used in a traditional blade, then proceed to the innovations of the microedge and zero-edge battle ribbons."

Black market sellers of voidhammers claim to have “liberated” them from the Lightbringers, who crafted them from anacite technology supposedly found on Anodyne. Voidhammers have the immobilize critical hit effect."
