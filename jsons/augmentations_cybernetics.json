The compartment can hold items of negligible bulk and items of light bulk that are either relatively small or can be folded or contracted to fit. A hideaway in a leg (in a human) can hold more than one in an arm, and the creature’s size also adjusts the capacity. The GM decides what can fit.\n\n When the compartment is closed, the seam in your flesh is difficult to detect. You gain a +2 bonus to Sleight of Hand checks to conceal items in a hideaway limb. Though this compartment can usually foil a simple pat down, most security checkpoints include a scan that can detect such devices. Retrieving an item from a hideaway limb is a move action instead of a standard action.\n\n This type of augmentation is for Small and Medium creatures only. Hideaway limbs for creatures larger than Medium typically cost more but can hold items of greater size or bulk.\n\n If you have a quickdraw hideaway limb, the compartment is integrated with a specific weapon. This allows you to draw the weapon as a swift action or as part of making an attack or full attack (similar to using the Quick Draw feat). A quickdraw hideaway limb works only if the limb is one you can normally aim and attack with, typically an arm. You can’t, for example, put a quickdraw hideaway limb in your leg and have the weapon spring into your hand.\n\n You can have a mount installed in a quickdraw limb that holds the weapon in place while you shoot. You still can’t use your hand for other purposes, but you gain a +2 bonus to KAC against disarm attempts. The mount can’t hold a weapon that requires more than one hand to operate. You can’t hide other objects inside a quickdraw hideaway limb—there’s room for only the weapon.\n\n Nothing stored in a hideaway limb is considered part of the cybernetic, and the stored item does not gain the cybernetic’s immunity to attacks affecting technological devices.\n"

A hideaway in a leg (in a human) can hold more than one in an arm, and the creature’s size also adjusts the capacity. The GM decides what can fit.\n\n When the compartment is closed, the seam in your flesh is difficult to detect. You gain a +2 bonus to Sleight of Hand checks to conceal items in a hideaway limb. Though this compartment can usually foil a simple pat down, most security checkpoints include a scan that can detect such devices. Retrieving an item from a hideaway limb is a move action instead of a standard action.\n\n This type of augmentation is for Small and Medium creatures only. Hideaway limbs for creatures larger than Medium typically cost more but can hold items of greater size or bulk.\n\n If you have a quickdraw hideaway limb, the compartment is integrated with a specific weapon. This allows you to draw the weapon as a swift action or as part of making an attack or full attack (similar to using the Quick Draw feat). A quickdraw hideaway limb works only if the limb is one you can normally aim and attack with, typically an arm. You can’t, for example, put a quickdraw hideaway limb in your leg and have the weapon spring into your hand.\n\n You can have a mount installed in a quickdraw limb that holds the weapon in place while you shoot. You still can’t use your hand for other purposes, but you gain a +2 bonus to KAC against disarm attempts. The mount can’t hold a weapon that requires more than one hand to operate. You can’t hide other objects inside a quickdraw hideaway limb—there’s room for only the weapon.\n\n Nothing stored in a hideaway limb is considered part of the cybernetic, and the stored item does not gain the cybernetic’s immunity to attacks affecting technological devices.\n"

Using a voice encoder is a standard action. You can use a voice encoder once per day, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use it again immediately.\n Before you can use a voice encoder, it must be programmed at a computer that can communicate with the voxbox wirelessly, through a datajack, or some other direct means. Programming a voxbox takes 1 minute. You program the device with the specific command or suggestion, as well as the Common phrase in which the instruction is hidden. (For example, the suggestion “Kill Raia Danviri” might be hidden behind the phrase, “I’m from the Stewards. Let me show you my badge.”) Until the voice encoder is reprogrammed, it can be used only to give the chosen command or suggestion, which is always concealed within the same Common phrase.\n"

Until the beginning of your next turn, your force field’s fast healing is halved, but against the designated opponent’s attacks, you increase your force field’s fortification percentage chance by 10% (maximum 100%) and gain DR/— based on the model of your force matrix. This benefit ends if you lose all the temporary Hit Points provided by your force field. The hand bearing the force matrix augmentation must be free to activate its abilities.\u003ctable class\u003d\"inner\"\u003e\n \u003ctbody\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003eModel\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003eLevel\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003ePrice\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e\u003cb\u003eDR\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eMk 1\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e5\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e3,300\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e3\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eMk 2\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e11\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e26,750\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e6\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eMk 3\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e17\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e278,100\u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e10\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n"

The new organ is controlled by a wirelessly paired processor installed in your heart. When you have a standard detoxifier installed, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Fortitude saves against diseases, drugs, poisons, and radiation, and you are immune to addiction. Once per day when affected by a poison, you can roll your Fortitude save twice and take the better result. The enhanced detoxifier grants all of the above bonuses, as well as the ability to roll saving throws against poison twice per day. In addition, you automatically stabilize if reduced to 0 Hit Points as a result of damage from a poison. The elite detoxifier grants immunity to poison, as well as the bonuses to other Fortitude saves from the standard model.\n"
