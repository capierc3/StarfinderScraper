The pad can be unfolded as a full action with more material appearing by magic until the cloth covers a 5-foot-square area. Anything placed on the pad vanishes into rel-state; up to 200 Bulk can be kept in rel-state at any one time, and all objects must be able to fit entirely on the pad. Items can be recalled from rel-state with a move action, appearing atop the unfolded pad."
