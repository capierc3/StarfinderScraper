    "Price": "1 per 100 miles",
    "type": "Transportation",
    "desc": "A grav-train is a hovering, multisection mass transport that runs a specific ground route, generally over a metal or ceramic rail. It is the cheapest way to move overland, but it requires significant infrastructure to operate and only runs to set locations on a (sometimes unreliable) schedule."

    "type": "Transportation",
    "desc": "This simple form of urban transport is generally similar to an urban cruiser but is assumed not to have the expense of a driver. In most major cities, dispatch can send a robo-taxi within a few minutes of a request to the company by infosphere or comm unit."

    "type": "Transportation",
    "desc": "Planets with large bodies of water often develop extensive commerce and transit networks by ship, hovership, and even submarine. This transport is slower than travel by plane, but cheaper per mile (and considered more relaxing by many travelers). Some planets have rigid lighter-than-air vessels as well, such as dirigibles, which tend to have similar accommodations, pricing, and speeds."

    "desc": "For quick trips from point to point on a planet, the fastest option is generally a suborbital flight. The price assumes a single seat and a small common area for storage; larger seats or even small cabins cost five to 10 times as much."

    "type": "Transportation",
    "desc": "Most civilized planets rely on technological transportation, but less-developed worlds often utilize living creatures for travel. Such creatures are as varied in size, shape, color, and features as the planets they inhabit. Typically, biological transport is slower and more expensive than automated travel, but in frontier regions, it may be the only option available. Biological transport can be rented on a daily basis, with prices determined by the size of the creature. The listed price does not include the cost of feeding and maintaining the creature. Generally, rented biological transport requires riders to control and direct the creatures, using the ride a creature task of the Survival skill."
