    "desc": "A grav-train is a hovering, multisection mass transport that runs a specific ground route, generally over a metal or ceramic rail. It is the cheapest way to move overland, but it requires significant infrastructure to operate and only runs to set locations on a (sometimes unreliable) schedule."

    "desc": "This simple form of urban transport is generally similar to an urban cruiser but is assumed not to have the expense of a driver. In most major cities, dispatch can send a robo-taxi within a few minutes of a request to the company by infosphere or comm unit."

    "desc": "Planets with large bodies of water often develop extensive commerce and transit networks by ship, hovership, and even submarine. This transport is slower than travel by plane, but cheaper per mile (and considered more relaxing by many travelers). Some planets have rigid lighter-than-air vessels as well, such as dirigibles, which tend to have similar accommodations, pricing, and speeds."
