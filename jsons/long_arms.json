    "desc": "Across the galaxy, practically every sufficiently advanced civilization has created its own variation of the freeze ray. All freeze rays function in a similar way, emitting a long line of supercooled gas, but individual models reflect their species’ design aesthetics. In the Pact Worlds, the most common models reflect the slim profile of Vercite technology or the bony protrusions of Eoxian design. Hiemal, algid, and glacial freeze rays simply produce an extreme reduction in the temperature along the weapon’s line of effect. Isothermal freeze rays cause a persistent temperature drop, dealing further damage, while hypothermic freeze rays causes multiple temperature reductions in rapid succession for further increased destruction."

These weapons are most commonly seen in the hands of space pirates who need to blast through plastic interior doors, though expert users can use these weapons to break through airlock doors. Breaching guns also saw widespread use on Absalom Station in the aftermath of the Gap, as security forces desperately tried to maintain control over the station’s fractured and panicked population, which often required blasting through barricades and sealed interior airlocks. Utility, snub, impact, vortex, and grapeshot breaching guns are widely available on various worlds."
