This weapon’s damage is significantly less than that achieved by the convergent lasers, but the same systems that synchronize wavelengths in a convergent laser allow the divergent laser to focus on multiple targets. The single-color beam of a single-wave divergent laser sets it apart from the shimmering colors of a multiwave divergent laser. A wide-spectrum divergent laser has a nearly white beam and could be mistaken for a spotlight at a glance—though not by a target struck by one!"

The spread of these filaments can be somewhat controlled, allowing a proficient user to avoid hitting a limited number of creatures within the weapon’s area of effect. Python-series hydra cannons offer the least control, while viper-series, asp-series, and cobraseries hydra cannons offer increasingly fine-tuned control over their target areas."

A resonator generates sonic waves at frequencies set to resound within the targeted material, allowing the weapon to deal precise damage regardless of the target’s composition or protection. If the integrated probing function is employed before firing, the resonator’s sonic frequencies can be precisely tuned. Diffraction and refraction resonators align sonic waves in specific patterns, while linear and phased resonators focus the sonic energy through specialized matrices for amplified output."
