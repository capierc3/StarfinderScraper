A monolith suit looks like a massive articulated golem formed of stone plates. Despite its size, monolith armor moves easily thanks to its power-assisted joints. Sigils and personal emblems can be “chiseled” on the breastplate or shoulder guards of a monolith suit to signal the wearer’s allegiance."

It blends archaic armor sensibilities with cutting-edge technology, resulting in an appearance that resembles a metallic construct as much as armor. Night plate’s design incorporates flaring cauldrons and razor-sharp leg spurs, though these impressive adornments have little function beyond intimidation. Highergrade models incorporate even more of these embellishments, cunningly designed to avoid interference with the armor’s primary functions."
